<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Bard Chimes is a Discord bot that has been built using the Node.js framework, and it utilizes the Riot Games API to access information about champions in League of Legends. This API allows Bard Chimes to retrieve information such as champion abilities, stats, and lore, which it then presents to users in an easy-to-understand format.

By using the Riot Games API, Bard Chimes is able to provide accurate and up-to-date information about League of Legends champions. This information is essential for new players who are still learning the ins and outs of the game, and it can also be useful for experienced players who are looking to explore new strategies and playstyles.

One of the key features of Bard Chimes is its ability to show players the weekly free champions. This is particularly useful for new players who may not be familiar with the various champions available in the game. By showing the free champions each week, Bard Chimes helps new players to learn about different champions and develop their own strategies for playing the game.

Overall, Bard Chimes is an excellent resource for new players who are looking to learn more about the champions in League of Legends. With its range of features and tools, it provides a wealth of information and guidance that can help players improve their skills and become more confident in the game. Whether you are a seasoned veteran or a new player, Bard Chimes is an essential tool that can help you get the most out of your League of Legends experience.

## Commands

### /championinfo

The /championinfo command is used to retrieve information about a specific champion in League of Legends. To use this command, simply type `/championinfo` followed by the name of the champion you are interested in learning more about. For example:

```
/championinfo Ahri
```

This command will return a variety of information about the champion, including their lore, skills, tips, and images. This information can be extremely helpful for new players who are still learning about the different champions in the game, as well as experienced players who are looking to explore new playstyles and strategies.

### /championrotation

The `/championrotation` command is used to retrieve a list of the free champions of the week in League of Legends. To use this command, simply type /championrotation.

```
/championrotation
```

This command will return a list of champions sorted by their role, making it easy to see which champions are currently available to play for free.

The free champion rotation changes on a weekly basis, so this command can be particularly useful for players who want to try out different champions without having to purchase them.
